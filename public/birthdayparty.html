<h3>What to bring:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>A Gift for the Birthday Pup – Because showing up empty-handed is ruff! A new toy, some treats, or maybe a doggy spa voucher?🍖🐾</li>
    <li>Your Dog (If You Have One) – No awkward moments when you realize you’re the only human there without a furry plus-one.💩🎈</li>
    <li>Treats for Bribery – To win over the birthday dog and any other judgmental floofs at the party.🐶💦</li>
    <li> Poop Bags – Because every party has its party pooper, and you don’t want to be that guest.💩🎈</li>
    <li>A Towel or Wet Wipes – Just in case things get… well, slobbery.</li>
    <li>A Camera (or Fully Charged Phone) – For capturing those priceless moments of chaos and cuteness. 📸🐕</li>
    <li>Comfortable Clothes – Because at some point, a dog will jump on you with muddy paws. 🐾👕</li>
    <li>A Leash (Even If Your Dog is ‘Well-Behaved’) – Trust me, they’ll see a squirrel and forget their entire life’s training. 🐿️🐕</li>
    <li>Doggy Party Hat (Optional, But Encouraged) – Let’s be real, they’ll wear it for 0.5 seconds, but it's worth it for the photo. 🎩🐶</li>
    <li>A Good Sense of Humor – Because someone’s dog will hump someone’s leg, steal cake, or knock over a drink. 🍰🐾</li>


</ul>
